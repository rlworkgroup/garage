## LocalRunner & LocalTFRunner for Garage experiment

`LocalRunner` class in Garage provides users with a range
of utilities to set up environment and train an algorithm
for an experiment.

```Python
runner = LocalRunner()
```

`LocalTFRunner` inherits `LocalRunner` class and provides
a default TensorFlow session using Python context.

```Python
with LocalTFRunner(snapshot_config=ctxt) as runner:
    ...
```

To perform the save, load and resume operations of
an experiment, `Local_runner` provides four core functions:

- `LocalRunner.save`: To save snapshot of a specific epoch.
    This function uses [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle)
    utility for serialization. All kind of Model, tensors and dictionaries
    objects related to the experiment setup and training statistics
    within the epoch with saved using this function.
- `LocalRunner.setup`: To setup `LocalRunner` instance for
    algorithm and environment in an experiment.
- `LocalRunner.train`: To train an algorithm given the training
    parameters.`
- `LocalRunner.restore`: To restore an experiment from snapsnot.
    This function uses cloudpickle's unplicking utilities to deserialize
    pickled object files and re-setup the environment and retrieve model
    data of a specified epoch.
- `LocalRunner.resume`: To train an algorithm from a restored
    experiment. This function provides the same interface as train().

## Saving & Training Models in an experiment

In general, saving and training models in an experiment includes
 the following steps:

- Initialize the `LocalRunner`/ `LocalTFRunner` instance
- Define the environment and algorithms for an experiment
- Setup the runner for algorithm and environment with `LocalRunner.setup`.
- Run the training step with `LocalRunner.train`

```Python
runner = LocalRunner()
env = Env(...)
policy = Policy(...)
algo = Algo(
        env=env,
        policy=policy,
        ...)
runner.setup(algo, env)
runner.train(n_epochs=100, batch_size=4000)
```

## Loading Models & Resuming an experiment

In general, loading models and resuming an experiment includes
 the following steps:

- Initialize the `LocalRunner`/ `LocalTFRunner` instance
- Restore the algorithm and experiment setup with `LocalRunner.restore`
- Define for the parameters we want to update during training
- Run the training step with `LocalRunner.resume`

```Python
# to resume immediately.
runner = LocalRunner()
runner.restore(resume_from_dir)
runner.resume()

# to resume with modified training arguments.
runner = LocalRunner()
runner.restore(resume_from_dir)
runner.resume(n_epochs=20)
```

### Example on loading TRPO model & finetuning

To provide a setp-by-step example, we will walk you through how to load
a pre-trained network and resume an experiment with
`TRPO`.

First, we specify the directory of snapshot object. By default,
    snapshot objects stored in under `data/local/experiment/`.

```python
snapshot_dir = 'mysnapshot/'  # specify the path
```

Next, we can load the pre-trained model with `runner.restore()`
by passing the directory path as an argument.

For fine-tunning, we can update the parameters i.e.
`n_epochs`, `batch_size` for training.

Last but not least, we start the training by
`runner.resume()` with defined parameters as arguments.

```python

@wrap_experiment
def pre_trained_trpo_cartpole(ctxt=None,
    snapshot_dir='data/local/experiment/trpo_gym_tf_cartpole',
    seed=1):
    set_seed(seed)
    with LocalTFRunner(snapshot_config=ctxt) as runner:
        runner.restore(snapshot_dir)
        runner.resume(n_epochs=30, batch_size=8000)

```

Let's start training now!

```python
pre_trained_trpo_cartpole(snapshot_dir=snapshot_dir)
```

Congratulation, you successfully load a pre-trained model and
start a new experiment!

Note that the experiment has been restored from the last epoch
and start training from that epoch 10 in the example.
