"""
This module implements a replay buffer memory.

Replay buffer is an important technique in reinforcement learning. It
stores transitions in a memory buffer of fixed size. When the buffer is
full, oldest memory will be discarded. At each step, a batch of memories
will be sampled from the buffer to update the agent's parameters. In a
word, replay buffer breaks temporal correlations and thus benefits RL
algorithms.
