    Example of a simple rollout loop:

    .. code-block:: python

        env = MyEnv()
        policy = MyPolicy()
        first_observation, episode_info = env.reset()
        env.visualize()  # visualization window opened

        episode = []
        # Determine the first action
        first_action = policy.get_action(first_observation, episode_info)
        episode.append(env.step(first_action))

        while not episode[-1].last():
           action = policy.get_action(episode[-1].next_observation)
           episode.append(env.step(action))

        env.close()  # visualization window closed

    Make sure your environment is pickle-able:
        Garage pickles the environment via the `cloudpickle` module
        to save snapshots of the experiment. However, some environments may
        contain attributes that are not pickle-able (e.g. a client-server
        connection). In such cases, override `__setstate__()` and
        `__getstate__()` to add your custom pickle logic.

        You might want to refer to the EzPickle module:
        https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/utils/ezpickle.py
        for a lightweight way of pickle and unpickle via constructor
        arguments.
