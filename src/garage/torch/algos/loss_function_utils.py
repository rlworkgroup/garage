    Advantages are a discounted cumulative sum.

    Calculate advantages using a baseline (value function) according to
    Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

    The discounted cumulative sum can be computed using conv2d with filter.
    filter:
        [1, (discount * gae_lambda), (discount * gae_lambda) ^ 2, ...]
        where the length is same with max_path_length.

        gae_lambda (float): Lambda, as used for Generalized Advantage
            Estimation (GAE).
        max_path_length (int): Maximum length of a single rollout.
        baselines (torch.Tensor): A 2D vector of value function estimates with
            shape (N, T), where N is the batch dimension (number of episodes)
            and T is the maximum path length experienced by the agent. If an
            episode terminates in fewer than T time steps, the remaining
            elements in that episode should be set to 0.
        rewards (torch.Tensor): A 2D vector of per-step rewards with shape
            (N, T), where N is the batch dimension (number of episodes) and T
            is the maximum path length experienced by the agent. If an episode
            terminates in fewer than T time steps, the remaining elements in
            that episode should be set to 0.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A 2D vector of calculated advantage values with shape
            (N, T), where N is the batch dimension (number of episodes) and T
            is the maximum path length experienced by the agent. If an episode
            terminates in fewer than T time steps, the remaining values in that
            episode should be set to 0.
