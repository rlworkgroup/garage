    Args:
        env_spec (EnvSpec): Specification of environment.
        learner (garage.torch.Policy): Policy to train.
        batch_size (int): Size of optimization batch.
        source (Policy or Generator[TimeStepBatch]): Expert to clone. If a
            policy is passed, will set `.policy` to source and use the trainer
            to sample from the policy.
        policy_optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): Optimizer to be used to
            optimize the policy.
        policy_lr (float): Learning rate of the policy optimizer.
        loss (str): Which loss function to use. Must be either 'log_prob' or
            'mse'. If set to 'log_prob' (the default), `learner` must be a
            `garage.torch.StochasticPolicy`.
        minibatches_per_epoch (int): Number of minibatches per epoch.
        name (str): Name to use for logging.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If learner` is not a
            `garage.torch.StochasticPolicy` and loss is 'log_prob'.
