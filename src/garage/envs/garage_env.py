    In order to provide pickling (serialization) and parameterization
    for gym.Envs, they must be wrapped with a GarageEnv. This ensures
    compatibility with existing samplers and checkpointing when the
    envs are passed internally around garage.

    Furthermore, classes inheriting from GarageEnv should silently
    convert action_space and observation_space from gym.Spaces to
    akro.spaces.

            exist, a `gym.error` is thrown.
        is_image (bool): True if observations contain pixel values,

            obs space to an akro.Image and normalizes pixel values.
