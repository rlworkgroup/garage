    In order to provide pickling (serialization) and parameterization
    for gym.Envs, they must be wrapped with a GarageEnv. This ensures
    compatibility with existing samplers and checkpointing when the
    envs are passed internally around garage.

    Furthermore, classes inheriting from GarageEnv should silently
    convert action_space and observation_space from gym.Spaces to
    akro.spaces.

    GarageEnv handles all environments created by gym.make().
    It returns a different wrapper class instance if the input environment
    requires special handling.
    Current supported wrapper classes are:
        garage.envs.bullet.BulletEnv for Bullet-based gym environments.
