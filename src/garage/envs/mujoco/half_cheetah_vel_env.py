    """Half-cheetah environment with target velocity, as described in [1].

    The code is adapted from
    https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl/blob/9c8e2ebd741cb0c7b8bf2d040c4caeeb8e06cc95/rllab/envs/mujoco/half_cheetah_env_rand.py

    The half-cheetah follows the dynamics from MuJoCo [2], and receives at each
    time step a reward composed of a control cost and a penalty equal to the
    difference between its current velocity and the target velocity. The tasks
    are generated by sampling the target velocities from the uniform
    distribution on [0, 2].
